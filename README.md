## What This Site Does

Our site chooses a recipe for you to make when you can't decide. It can also take in some suggestions to thin out the results.

## Known Problems
- If you want to use "Get My Recipe" button you have to fill out all 3 input fields or the button won't pull up a recipe.
- The site likes to pull up the same recipe when using the "Random Popular Recipe"

## Other Notes
This was my first group project for my Full Stack Class. I worked on the front end with another one of my classmates. The original was a fun project but it used very strong language so I edited so it and made this.
